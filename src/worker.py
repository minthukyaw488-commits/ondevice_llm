"""
Client handle for the assistant worker process.

The heavy pipeline (RAG + torch models + chromadb) runs in a SEPARATE process
(src/worker_server.py) launched as a clean subprocess - it never imports
Streamlit. This matters on macOS: when the worker was started via
multiprocessing "spawn", the child re-imported app.py and thus Streamlit
before torch, and the native-library mix crashed with a bus error (SIGBUS).
A plain subprocess that only imports the pipeline avoids that entirely.

Communication is line-delimited JSON over the subprocess's stdin/stdout; the
worker's stderr is inherited so its [worker] logs appear in the terminal.
